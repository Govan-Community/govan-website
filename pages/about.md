## GOVAN COMMUNITY COUNCIL

Govan Community Council was established in 1976 under the new
legislation on local government passed in 1973. This described community
councils as the third tier of government with responsibility ensuring
that the voice of the local communities was heard. Community Councils
have legal rights to oppose (or support) planning applications and
licensing applications and to be consulted on all matters affecting
their community. They are required to be non-sectarian and non-party
political (but not non-political).

Govan Community Council currently meets monthly on the first Monday
(unless a public holiday). It currently meets in the Ground Floor Cafe
of The Pearce Institute at 840-860 Govan Rd, Glasgow G51 3UU. The next
meeting is scheduled for Monday 3rd of November 2025 at 7pm.    

The Chair is Claire Dickson, Vice Chair is Willie Jones, and the 
secretary is Greg Easton. Updated contact details will be provided
soon.
