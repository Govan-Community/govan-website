1.  MINUTES OF THE MAY MEETING\
    These were moved as correct by Hannah Salome and Gordon Mackay.

2 MATTERS ARISING

a)  **Cleansing, environment, litter crisis and drains crisis**

> Issues were raised in particular by our Secretary and by Annie Morgan.
> Esme reported receiving as a householder a letter from Cleansing
> indicating the new bin colours and content regulations and the
> instruction that householders themselves must affix labels of the
> appropriate colour (black for paper; grey for plastics and cans (with
> a wider range of plastic types allowed than before); and blue for food
> waste. It was noted there would be four week wait for grey stickers.
> Esme felt that this introduced quite unnecessary levels of
> complication which would militant against widespread response. Cllr
> Alam said he would investigate and indicated that as far he knew there
> had been no consultation with councillors. Annie Morgan reported
> problems misuse with the introduction of street based black bins in
> parts of Elderpark -- exampling babies' used nappies lying open in one
> of the bins outside the soon-to-be opened community grocers shop. She
> voiced fears about the introduction of 'hubs' in terms of potentially
> similar misuse and stressed the full community consultation would be
> essential. Annie also suggested that the Community Council invite a
> representative from the community-based partnership responsible for
> cleansing in Renfrewshire.
>
> It was NOTED that letters to the two Housing Association Executives,
> as agreed at the last meeting, had been written but the relevant
> correspondence with our Secretary had been delayed in the post,
> despite first class stamps, by over six days. One we had a response we
> would also write to relevant officials in the City Council.

b)  **Closure of Bank of Scotland**

> Gordon Mackay further reported on his investigations regarding the
> legal responsibilities of banks to provide banking services that
> matched the needs of local communities. He had now identified a
> Working Paper being produced by the Financial Conduct Authority under
> the terms of Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 that was intended
> as the basis for legislation by government to ensure that the entire
> population was within one mile of a free to use cash machine. Gordon
> noted that the 'free to use' cash machine on the back wall of the
> chemists facing the shopping centre carpark had been removed in the
> past month and there were now big queues at Morrisons' cash machine
> (only available when the shop was open).
>
> Chris Stephens MP was maintaining his initiative, led locally by
> Alastair Shaw, to secure a cash hub in the subway, a meeting had been
> held and discussions were continuing with Barclays Bank
>
> It was AGREED that we should publicise our local campaign in the
> Glasgow press in order to link up with other campaigns in the city. It
> was also important to raise with those responsible for the City Plan
> and the development of the Partick-Govan bridge because of its
> specific intention to expedite economic investment and growth on the
> Govan side of the river. The lack of both banks and cash machines
> would be major disincentives. The meeting felt that in immediate
> circumstance it was probably not sensible to place too much weight on
> the possibility of initiatives by the informal/community sector such
> as the Credit Union.

**c) Elder Park Library: Reopening and Provision of Café**

Councillors present reiterated their understanding that the Library
would reopen in June. It would, however, not contain a café (although
kitchen facilities were available). There was no clear indication as to
whom, within Glasgow Life, had taken the decision, it seems, at a very
late stage. There was some feeling that local voluntary provision might
be possible and also be cheaper.

It was AGREED to write to Glasgow Life and the Council Chief Executive
deploring what seemed to be a breach of trust on the question of the
café -- a decision taken without consultation.

**d) Community Notice Board in the Shopping Centre**

It was AGREED to raise with the Shopping Centre administration the
willingness of the Community Council to meet the financial costs of
increasing the size of the existing noticeboard and to provide adequate
lighting.

**e) £1 million Infrastructure Improvement Fund**

A very considerable range of projects had been put forward by voluntary
organisations in the Greater Govan Area. Bidding had now closed (12
May). Residents will be eligible to vote between 12 August and 29 August
on which proposals should be implemented.

**f) Show People's access to their site**

Subsequent to the discussion at the April Community Council it was felt
that the City Council might be taking a more realistic and constructive
approach in recent discussions. Councillors were ASKED to liaise with
Council officers to ensure that progress was made.

3\. COMMUNITY COUNCIL PUBLIC MEETING 25 APRIL

While attendance was a bit disappointing (probably partly a consequence
of a very partial Royal Mail distribution of our newsletter: only one in
two of those attending the CC meeting had received copies) it was felt
that the meeting as a whole was worthwhile and useful. Hannah was
congratulated on both the organisation and her own presentation.

Hannah stressed the expanding community-focus of the Ferett and the
significance of Karen Goodwin's research on housing and homelessness.
She also stressed the seriousness of problems in Govan -- especially in
Central Govan -- including fear among newcomers of speaking out and also
the need for more translators to ensure that issues were raised.
Homelessness was growing more acute. So was criminal and anti-social
behaviour. It was important that Housing Associations faced up to their
responsibilities.

In terms of future meetings it was felt that the convenience and
ambience of the PI Café had helped the success of the meeting.

Subsequently it was agreed that the Pearce Institute Café would provide
an excellent venue for the Community Council itself and it was AGREED to
check with Betty Ross availability on a Monday evening in the coming
year.

4\. SECRETARY'S REPORT

**Future of the Lyceum**

Our Secretary reported on progress in establishing a Community
Development Trust by the Central Govan Action Plan on behalf of the
Lyceum Preservation Trust. The Trust was now registered with OSCAR and
required signatures from local residents. The objective was to attract
into Govan visitors from across Scotland and beyond. The meeting
expressed its thanks to Esme for helping to take the initiative on this
front.

**Mary Barbour statue**

Esme congratulated all those who had taken the initiative in erecting
the statue. Three times in the last month the statue had provided the
focus point for those campaigning for women's rights and working class
rights in general: for Waspi Women on pensions, for Equal Pay and
against cuts of jobs in education. It was also noted that BAE
functionaries had attempted to associate themselves with the statute.
This was felt to be wholly inappropriate given Mary Barbour's stance
against militarism and war. It was felt that when Mary's 150^th^
anniversary came up in 2025 we should support any moves to name the
bridge, the Mary Barbour Bridge. The Bridge was now expected to open in
November.

5\. CHAIR'S REPORT: PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW SUBWAY CARRIAGES

1.The ride quality of the new trains is atrocious. Far worse than the
old trains. The carriages swing violently from side to side, especially
when the trains are accelerating. This makes for a very unpleasant
journey. It is astonishing that the new trains are less comfortable than
trains that are over 40 years old.

2\. The ride quality isn\'t helped by the seats on the new trains.
Unlike the old carriages the seats are completely unpadded. They are a
flat bench style, covered only by thin fabric. It\'s like sitting on a
plank, with your back against another plank. 

3\. The carriage seat layout is poor. The old seats were shaped into
pairs of seats with vertical poles separating the seats in the middle of
the carriage. The seats now consist of a long flat bench and the poles
have gone. This means that passengers are far more likely to sprawl over
more than one seat.

4\. There are no longer overhead hand grips above the doors or on either
side of the doors. When the trains are busy passengers tend to
congregate at the doors. Now they have nothing to hold onto, unless they
are near the vertical handrails on either side of the door. This is a
health and safety issue.

5\. Similarly, there are no longer poles or vertical hand rails in the
middle of the carriage so passengers can only hold onto the overhead
handrail, which doesn\'t suit everyone.

6\. To make matters worse, the overhead handrail in the middle of the
carriage is too low, at least a couple of inches lower than the old
handgrips. If you stand straight up from your seat, you hit your head
off the handrail. 

7\. There are bound to be teething problems with new trains but there
are constant delays and breakdowns, and often only one circle is
operating. When this happens communication is terrible. This morning at
Govan passengers waited 15 minutes on the platform with not a single
tannoy announcement explaining what was happening. Similarly, the trains
are often kept waiting at stations for several minutes with no
announcement from the driver explaining the delay.

8\. When announcements are made, either by the station staff or the
driver, they are often inaudible or unintelligible, especially inside
the trains. This is another health and safety issue. In the event of an
emergency, it is essential that passengers can hear announcements. It
would appear that no one in the Subway ever checks that the tannoys can
be heard by passengers on the platforms or on the trains.

9\. Most journeys now take longer than they did previously. A journey
between Govan and St Enoch\'s or Buchanan Street that previously took 12
or 15 minutes now often takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and sometimes
even longer.

10\. The real time arrival information has disappeared from the
electronic display boards. Now they only show the train frequency, for
instance every 4 minutes or 8 minutes. Since passengers travelling
between Govan and the city centre can use either circle this is a major
problem. You can no longer tell whether the trains on either circle are
due in one minute or ten minutes.

11\. The service frequency at rush hour appears to be reduced at times.
Instead of the previous 4 minute service at peak hours this is now often
down to 6 or 8 minutes. When this happens it also means that the trains
are more overcrowded.

12\. This isn\'t a new problem but there has been no WiFi in the
stations for about 4 years now, which is very poor in this day and age.

On the plus side, the new trains are quieter, brighter, and the ability
to move between carriages is very useful. In general, however, there has
been a massive deterioration in the service. 

6\. VICE CHAIR's REPORT

Hannah drew our attention to an event on Friday 17 May at 12.30 with
music and food to celebrate cultural diversity at Park Villa, 337
Langlands Rd,

7\. TREASURER'S REPORT

Reinhild reported that a cheque had been sent to Forward Print covering
the cost of printing the Spring Govan Letter.

8\. COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS

**Councillor Dornan** reported on a new initiative by SPT to place real
time notice boards for all buses leaving Govan bus station.

**Councillor Hutchison** noted the motion before the City Council on
Thursday to establish a firework control zone and establish instead a
publicly run firework display (in line with what was Govan CC policy).

9\. ANY OTHER BUSINESS

**a) Air fryers**

Community adoption of Air Fryers: C. Edugie Robertson from Glasgow Life
reported on the project to develop the adoption of Air Fryers by local
community organisations including Community Councils. Air fryers used 50
percent less power and provided better nutrition. She hoped that the
Community Council might support an application for the funding of
training.

**b) Protection of community space in Elderpark**

Annie Morgan raised the problems raised for community spaces in the
Elderpark area -- specifically the Moogetty gardens -- in face the
building of two blocks of flats and associated parking. These are likely
to knock out access, possibly more, unless the community comes together
to resist. Annie hoped that once she had brought together a group of
stake-holders the Community Council would send a representative.
