1.  MINUTES OF THE FEBRUARY MEETING\
    These were moved as correct by Hannah Salome and Esme Clark

2 SPECIAL ISSUES

a)  **As raised by Annie Morgan: Cleansing, environment, litter crisis
    and drains crisis**

> Annie was accompanied by Katherine McNab, tenant of Elderpark HA and
> Treasurer of Elderpark pensioners. The following points were made.
>
> **The problem**
>
> Cleansing pick-up, fly tipping, dog fouling, flooding and street
> debris were particularly bad in Crossloan Road, Elderpark Street,
> Luath Street (where dumped timber had caught fire: fire brigade had to
> stop spread to tenements), Shaw Street with new street bins not
> reducing dumping. Elderpark HA informed but not responding. Annie and
> Gina noted that situation in Renfrew much better: more regular
> collections, days of collection continually updated on web and on
> leaflets, instruction on what litter to put where. Issues of
> flytipping, dog mess and unsafe parking had been raised with police
> and council for prosecution but not seen to warrant action. Gordon
> MacKay asked if the new bin project in Pollokshields was a pilot for
> the City: Cllr Alam confirmed it was.
>
> Proposals

-   It **was agreed** that the problem did not lie with cleansing staff
    who were seriously depleted compared with ten years ago -- probably
    by over ten percent -- and with age profile (and health and injury
    vulnerability) correspondingly higher. Urgent steps were needed to
    create a bigger younger workforce (Ruth suggested that this might be
    a good option for refugees now looking for work). There was some
    scepticism about moving bins into the street and about bigger street
    bins

-   Bin hubs, as piloted in Pollokshields, were suggested by Cllr Alam
    (if properly managed). It was noted that Linthouse HA operated a
    weekly clean-up and close liaison with both cleansing and tenants.)
    Gordon MacKay asked if this pilot was to be extended to the whole
    city and expressed some scepticism.

-   Annie Morgan suggested, **and it was agreed**, that we actively
    learn from Renfrew's tenant, union, council, participation scheme
    and a conference involving all parties in Govan to discuss. However,
    the statutory authorities could not shift responsibilities to local
    residents -- the key issue for residents was better information (in
    multiple languages) and education.

-   Comments by Councillors: agreement that a conference would be
    useful; Cllr Hutchison would make enquiries with Cleansing and also
    seek employment data since 2004: Jim Shaw, representing Chris
    Stephens MP, noted the collapse of the service over Christmas across
    the constituency.

b)  **Dig-it conference and sponsorship by Barclays Bank**: Annie raised
    the issue of the bank's involvement in the financing of armaments
    and mineral extraction damaging the environment: agreed to return to
    this next meeting.

c)  **Closure of Bank of Scotland**

> Alastair Shaw reported that our MP was pressing for the BoS building
> to be made over as a bank hub with a cash machine. He was considering
> a public meeting over the Easter break.
>
> Gordon MacKay reported that the BoS had come back with nothing
> positive apart from saying that the post office in Craigton Rd had a
> cash machine (although only available during opening hours).
>
> The previous meeting had agreed to securing a cash machine in the
> bus/subway station. **Cllr Dornan committed himself** to make the
> request to the meeting of the SPT Executive on Wed 6 March.

d)  **Bus Transport and petition:** agreed to return to at the next
    meeting

e)  **Living Rents and Tenants issues**: rents and repairs The Living
    Rent speaker gave apologies (ill health)

f)  **Govan Music Festival:** members were encouraged to participate:
    Our Secretary would attend and review (for Govan Letter).

3.MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

Issues not covered so far:

a)  **Show People's access to their site at Water Row:**

> A letter had been sent by our Secretary to the City Council. No
> response had been received so far (although cc. to Councillors). Cllr
> Hutchison asked that any reply be sent to all Councillors. The issue
> remained urgent. Theresa was pushing for a meeting with the Council

b)  **Maslow's use as community surgery for CC**

> Ruby confirmed that the premises could be made available

c)  **City Council Budget**

> Cuts were reported by Councillors as teaching staff, Glasgow Life,
> transport (complete loss of capital budget), housing (but in Glasgow
> via Has) and posts ion adult community education training. Other cuts
> were passed through the joint Council-Heath/Social budget. Funding
> raising initiatives were being investigated in terms of visitor
> parking (to go mainly to Glasgow Life), extension of parking charges
> (GCC needed to get legal cover: a year's delay) and, at Scottish
> government level, more progressive council tax banding (it was noted
> that freezing existing bands proportionately assisted the better off).
> There was concern about the Westminster budget later in the week and
> likely further cuts in budgets affecting public services.

d)  **Govan Notice Board in Shopping Centre**

> Rob Preston will make enquiries and report. A letter will then be
> written offering to pay.

7, SECRETARY'S REPORT

Our Secretary reported her concern at the patronising and uninformed
content of a new and lavishly produced leaflet on road safety for
pedestrians (produced by the City Council and Police Scotland). Most of
the advice assumed utopian style roads and pavements -- not flooded
roads, mass pavement parking, potholes in roads and pavements, debris on
both roads pavements and lack of active prosecution of one of the
biggest hazards: high speed bikes and electric scooters on pavements.
Cllr Hutchison would investigate.

8\. COUNCILLORS' REPORTS

**Councillors Alam and Dornan** said they had already given the main
issues they wished to raise

**Councillor Hutchison** reported on the Library completion (end May),
on the new MAFALDA database on the Neighbourhood Infrastructure Fund,
and the Cycle Path consultation.

**Alistair Shaw for Chris Stephens:** Chris wished to draw our attention
to the House of Commons Library report, dated 1 March, on asylum seekers
in transfer to Refugee status which indicates virtually no progress
despite earlier pledges. [Asylum statistics - House of Commons Library
(parliament.uk)](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01403/)
